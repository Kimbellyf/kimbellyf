### Hi there 👋

Hello, my name is <b><i>Kimbelly Ferraz</i></b>.
I'm a software developer towards fullstack. I am a person curious about new technologies and computer languages and you will find me occasionally learning a new language or risking something related lol. Here you will find some projects that are part of my continuous learning! :blue_book: :book: 😄

The languages that I have most knowledge at the moment are <b> Java, Python </b> 👨‍💻.  👩•💻But I also have knowledge in other languages, I am currently working with <b>Typescript</b> and <b>Javascript</b>. I have also worked with frameworks such as <b>Angular, ReactJS, native Android, VueJS, Django,</b> among others.

By the way I am open to new ideas, new projects, if you want to talk to me feel free. You can contact me at 📫:
